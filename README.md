# Dark Humor Internet Memes
## Detecting dark humor intensity within internet memes
- Includes all the required `code` and `data` to identify a dark humor category (ranging from 0 to 3) on each meme.
- All of the internet memes studied in this project are in `Anno-1000.xlsx`. (A total of 1002 memes)
- All the embeddings are stored in numpy arrays (`.npy` files under `Data`)
- Identifying a dark humor category with SVM, LR, RF, MLP is in `Multiclass_classification.ipynb`

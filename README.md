- Includes all the required `code` and `data` to output a dark humor score (ranging from 0 to 1) on each meme.
- All of the internet memes used in this project are in `Anno-500.xlsx` and `Anno-1000.xlsx`. 
- Predicting dark humor score with MLP using 1002 dataset and 500 dataset, are in `MLPregressor_1000.ipynb` and `MLPregressor_500.ipynb`, respectively.
- Predicting dark humor score with Lasso regression, is in `Lasso_Ridge.ipynb`.
